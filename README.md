# Segmentation Border Analysis with GradCAM
This repository publishes the code used to create the GradCAM border analysis presented in the IPCAI 2024 Paper "Ultrasound Segmentation Analysis via Distinct and Completed Anatomical Borders".
It also includes the network architectures and weights of the pretrained models which were subject to the analyzation: UNet, Attention UNet and UNet Transformer, as well as an example image with its corresponding labels (including a full label as well as the distinct- and completed-border labels) for both examined ultrasound datasets: the leg muscle dataset and the thyroid dataset.
